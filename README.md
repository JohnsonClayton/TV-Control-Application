# TV Control Application
## Current Idea:
This application is made with the goal in mind of allowing a phone connect and control a television on the local area network (LAN). 
- What do we want to use?
  - Raspberry Pi
  - iPhone 
  - Skllz
- Helpful things to have
  - Put links here for stuff
  
## Process
### Phone -> App -> Website -> Pi -> *Something* -> TV
- Step 1:
  - Set up the Pi
  - Set up an app on phone (Apache Cordova)
  - Connect to same network
- Step 2: 
  - Create hello world app that talks to local hosted web app
    - (App -> Website -> Pi)
  - Ensure input from phone
- Step 3:
  - Use commands from manual for TV to create + demonstrate control over TV with code
    - Code may be in C or other lower-level situation
- Step 4:
  - Find a way to connect the js from website and the code used to command TV
